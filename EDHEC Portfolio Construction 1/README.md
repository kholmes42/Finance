The project largely uses publically available data from the Fama French Library.

## Efficient Frontier

We begin with the simple depiction of the efficient frontier for a mean variance investor. Under EMH the maximizing sharpe ratio portfolio is the market portfolio as indicated by the red dot. However, optimizers are very sensitive to risk and return inputs. Therefore it is difficult to say with certainty what this portolfio is. Given that volatility estimates tend to be realatively more stable, an alternative for an investor is the Global Minimum Variance (GMV orange dot) portfolio which mimimzes risk as measured by variance of returns. We also indicate a simple equal weighted portfolios which plots close to the GMV without having to rely on any input risk.
